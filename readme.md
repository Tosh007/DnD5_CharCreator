# DnD5_CharCreator
This is a helper program to create Characters for Dungeons and Dragons 5
to run it you need python3 and PyQt5
Still work in progress, and many things are not yet fully implementented  
(Racial Traits for all races) and some (e.g. starting items)  
not even touched yet)

for windows users, the zip BUILD_exe.win-amd64-3.5.zip is available.  
should anyone want a package for a different platform, just tell me.
