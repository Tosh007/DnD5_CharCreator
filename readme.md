# DnD5_CharCreator
This is a helper program to create Characters for Dungeons and Dragons 5
still WIP, features working:
*tracking all depending values (strength score => mod => ...)
*selection of race, class (1st lvl class specialization missing)
*score computation
*feats
*proficiencies
*spells (wip)

for windows users, there is a standalone application including required binaries
it automatically downloads the latest files from this repo
and starts CharCreator.py

for linux users, you should be able to run this from source (python3 CharCreator.py)
this program depends on PyQt5 and python3, make sure they're installed
